# Delivery-Managment-System-CS
In 4 days (approximatly 25 hours) I built this basic automation desktop app for a course and personal developement. I created a delivery managment system scenerio in my head and tried to make it real from a scratch by using C# and .NET Framework.
Trying to create minimalist design but i am not really statisfied from the solution.

### Features

- CRUD Operations for cargos, customers and branches.
- Modular programming to extends limits for needs.
- Functional country, state and city data keeping. (By help of a data set cities are linked to states and states are linked to countries.)
- Barcode system for cargos. (Barcodes are being saved in database)
- Data displaying in a card view by using panel system in c# winform. Not ugly as data grid view.
- Data searching by using all of the columns, not just id or name.
- Sort by alphabetical order, created_at or updated at. ASC, DESC.
